# Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru (Psychic Killer Taromaru) English Patch
An English patch for the Sega Saturn Japanese exclusive, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinrei_Jusatsushi_Tar%C5%8Dmaru>Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru.

Also known as Psychic Killer Taromaru or Psychic Assassin Taromaru. "Psychic Killer Taromaru" seems to have gained steam as the colloquial Western name, so I'm rolling with that.



## **Overview**
This patched was created mostly as testbed for my Saturn romhacking skills, to see if I could easily find and update textures. To that end, the following changes have been made:

- Opening credits translated to English
- Fully translated Options menu
- English title added to Title screen
- Spelling mistake "Time Warner Intearctive" on Title screen fixed
- In-game UI translated
- Opening and ending narration dubbed in English

#### **DUB??? You some kind of psychopath?!**

I felt that some additional story clarification was needed for English speakers to help set the game up better (though to be fair, the game is essentially a beat 'em up, so it's not *that* necesssary). 

But it's also why I'm offering two versions of the patch: 

  1. One dubbed, that has all the texture updates
  2. One in the original Japanese, that has all the texture updates

## **Patching Instructions**

1. Unzip patch bundle
2. Open SegaSaturnPatcher.exe
3. After it opens, click 'Select Saturn Game'
4. Next click "CD Image"
5. Find your original disc image on your computer, then click 'Open'
6. Click the '+ Game Patch (SSP)' button
7. Select the either the dubbed or non-dubbed .ssp patch and click 'Open'
8. Finally, select 'Build Image' and choose a directory to save it to
9. Burn to disc or play in your favorite Sega Saturn emulator (Mednafen is recommended, Ymir as well. Yabasanshio is playable but seems to have some audio crackling on the latest public Windows released)

**--> Important! <--**
- Tested with Shinrei Jusatsushi Taroumaru (Japan)
- Use the included version of SegaSaturnPatcher (1.95.8035.20705). This seems to handle the replacement CDDA tracks better than other versions. (Disregard this note if using the non-dubbed patch)

## **Helpful Game Notes**

1. In the Options screens, "HP Disp" turns on/off the boss life bars.
2. Don't forget that you can recruit enemies to fight alongside you! Use the "Ally" button to hit 'em with your recruiting spirit magic.
3. The **Skull** and **+** icons in the middle of the screen indicate the number of enemies you've killed and the health of your ally, respectively.
