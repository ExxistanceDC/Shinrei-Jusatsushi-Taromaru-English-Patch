# Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru (Psychic Killer Taromaru) English Patch
An English patch for the Sega Saturn Japanese exclusive, Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru.

Also known as Psychic Killer Taromaru or Psychic Assassin Taromaru. "Psychic Killer Taromaru" seems to have gained steam as the colloquial Western name, so I'm rolling with that.

## **Overview**
This patched was created mostly as testbed for my Saturn romhacking skills, to see if I could easily find and update textures. To that end, the following changes have been made:

- Opening credits translated to English
- Fully translated Options menu
- English title added to Title screen
- Spelling mistake "Time Warner Intearctive" on Title screen fixed
- In-game UI translated
- Opening narration dubbed in English

## **Patching Instructions**

1. Unzip patch bundle
2. Open SegaSaturnPatcher.exe
3. After it opens, click 'Select Saturn Game'
4. Next click "CD Image"
5. Find your original disc image on your computer, then click 'Open'
6. Click the '+ Game Patch (SSP)' button
7. Select the .ssp patch and click 'Open'
8. Finally, select 'Build Image' and choose a directory to save it to

**--> Important! <--**
- Tested with Shinrei Jusatsushi Taroumaru (Japan)
- Use the included version of SegaSaturnPatcher (1.95.8035.20705). This seems to handle the replacement CDDA tracks better than other versions.
